            <h1>Gujarat</h1>
            <p>Gujarat is a state with a water shortage, with just 1137 m3 of fresh water available per person. Even
                now, there are persistent water shortages in several parts of the state. Potable water is in poor supply
                in several areas of the state, especially in North Gujarat, Saurashtra, and Kachchh. Water security in
                recent years has, relatively speaking, improved from the scenario that existed earlier, with an assured
                water supply assisting significant economic and agricultural growth, however, concerns about an
                inconsistent water supply in the outlying rural communities persist. Despite efforts to supplement
                resources, there are still issues with appropriate water supply due to the state’s geology, growing
                population, and rapid industrialization.</p>

            <p>Government Initiatives towards Security of Drinking Water
                In view of the fact that Gujarat is prone to drought, it has been difficult for the state government to
                ensure that a sizable population in Kachchh, Saurashtra, and North Gujarat has access to safe and
                reliable drinking water, which has forced policy planners of the state to plan for these water- starved
                regions. Multifarious institutions and organizations such as the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board
                (GWSSB), Gujarat Jalseva Training Institute (GJTI), Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL), Gujarat
                Water Resource Development Centre (GWRDC), Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL), Water and
                Sanitation Management Organisation (WASMO) and Gujarat Infrastructure Development Board (GIDB) are
                responsible for ensuring that potable water is supplied to the rural population with enough quantity,
                which is not only safe but also affordable.
            </p>
            <h2>Narmada Master Plan</h2>
            <p> A project to supply drinking water from the Narmada Canal was started through a State Wide Drinking
                Water Grid that provides access to water to roughly 75 per cent of the state’s residents. GWSSB and
                Gujarat Water Infrastructure Ltd (GWIL) are working together to implement the Narmada Master Plan, which
                is intended to cover 9490 villages and 173 towns in Gujarat (www.wasmo.org, n.d.). GWSSB and GWIL
                receive water from the Narmada Nigam. By the end of March 2019, 8911 villages and 165 towns had been
                granted access to drinking and residential water pipelined from the Narmada. Additionally, the Narmada
                Nigam has been providing water directly to 28 Industries in the state as well as the Vadodara Municipal
                Corporation, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, Bharuch, Kapadvanj, and Tharad Nagarpalika.
            </p>
            <h2>Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)
            </h2>
            <p>The Prime Minister announced Jal Jeevan Mission – Har Ghar Jal on August 15, 2019 while addressing the
                nation on Independence Day. The Mission, under implementation, in partnership with the states, aims to
                enable every household in villages to have Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024. It is
                envisaged that with FHTC, each household will have potable water supply in adequate quantity (at least
                55 lpcd) of prescribed quality (as per BIS 10500:2012) on regular- and long-term basis.

            </p>
            <p>In October 2022, Gujarat was designated as a “Har Ghar Jal” state, which means that all rural families
                now have access to clean drinking water from faucets, ensuring that “No One is Left Out.” All 9,173,378
                homes in the state now have access to water, according to government data.</p>

            <h1>Rajasthan</h1>
            <p>Rural Rajasthan’s water crisis is real. Believe me there are people who are only drinking a litre of
                water everyday. Barely managing their water needs amidst the face of crisis is the only option for some
                families of rural Rajasthan. I was on the outskirts of Jaipur with my field team exploring villages
                where Tarun Bharat Sangh operates and functions towards solving issues of extreme water crises along
                with the help of people facing the issues. </p>
            <div class="image-item"><img src="images/th (2).jpg" alt="Image 2"></div>
            <p>People living in villages under Kalwada, Bhamboriya and Nevta Panchayats, part of Saganer Tehsil of
                Jaipur, have been grappling with water scarcity for decades. They have adjusted their lives to the
                problems stemming from malpractices and dyeing industries, which have contributed to the present
                conditions. It is not just the local water sources which are heavily contaminated but the groundwater
                also has high fluoride concentration. In a research paper published in 2023, a maximum of 37 mg/l of
                fluoride concentration was reported in the groundwater in rural areas across Rajasthan1. Concentration
                of fluoride beyond 1.5 mg/L by either geogenic or anthropogenic means has been classified as fluoride
                pollution of groundwater (Shekhar, 2017).2

            <h2>Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan </h2>
            <p>CM launched the campaign from village Gardan Kheri in Jhalawar district of Rajasthan on 27th January
                2016.
                The Scheme is based on Four-waters Concept that involves harvesting of available runoff (rain water,
                ground water, under-ground water & in situ soil moisture) in rural areas by treatment of catchment,
                proper utilization, renovation & creation of new water harvesting structures.

                It is a premier agency of the Government of Rajasthan that has played an important role in the
                industrial development of Rajasthan, it was formed in 1980.

        <h1>Punjab</h1>
        <p>Though Punjab’s water crisis has been in the making for the past over three decades, no serious efforts have
            been made to address it. Paradoxically, all stakeholders, including political parties, have been hitherto in
            the denial mode about the gravity of water insecurity.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, the state government now seems to be seized of the emerging water crisis, going by the convening
            of a brainstorming session on the problem by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh in Chandigarh on June 21.
            The meeting was attended by various stakeholders, including farmer leaders, representatives of the industry,
            experts and scientists, besides Cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats. The in-principle approval by the
            CM to constitute the Punjab Water Authority — though long overdue — is certainly a step forward.

        </p>
        <div class="image-item"><img src="images/th.jpg" alt="Image 4"></div>
        <p>Punjab was once comfortably placed in terms of water availability, but over the years, the situation
            deteriorated. In 1984, Punjab had 2.44 million acre ft (MAF) of groundwater, which dwindled to minus 11.63
            MAF in 2013. It was mainly due to overexploitation of groundwater. </p>
        <p>percent (2.37 lakh hectares) in 1939. Even in 1970-71, 9.62 per cent of the net sown area was under paddy.
            Nonetheless, paddy has been a major crop of Punjab since the 1980s and the area under it went up to 72 per
            cent of the net sown area in 2015-16.
        </p>
        <p>The Green Revolution transformed Punjab’s diversified cropping system into wheat-paddy rotation. The
            country’s increasing demand for food and the vested interests of global agri-business, inter alia, were the
            major factors behind the Green Revolution and the promotion of paddy in Punjab. The assured supply of
            high-yielding varieties of seeds, fertilisers and public investment in irrigation were aimed at meeting
            these objectives. The public procurement under the MSP regime (since the mid-1960s) assured market clearance
            for the farmers’ produce of wheat and paddy.
