        <h1>Save Water - Fix Leaks</h1>
      <p>Conserving water for a sustainable future</p>
        <p>Did you know that household leaks in the United States waste nearly <strong>1 trillion gallons of water annually</strong>? Thatâ€™s enough water to supply over 11 million homes for a year!</p>
      <p>Here are some key reasons why fixing leaks matters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>**Environmental Impact**: Reducing water waste preserves freshwater resources and reduces the energy required for water treatment and delivery.</li>
        <li>**Cost Savings**: A dripping tap can waste more than 3,000 gallons of water annually, leading to higher water bills.</li>
        <li>**Global Water Crisis**: With over 2 billion people lacking access to safe water globally, minimizing wastage is a crucial step toward water security.</li>
      </ul>
