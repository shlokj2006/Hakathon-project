        <h1>Smart Water Sensors - Efficient Water Management</h1>
        <p>Innovative technology to monitor and conserve water</p>
      <h2>Why Smart Water Sensors are Important</h2>
      <p>Freshwater resources are under severe stress, with nearly <strong>25% of the global population facing high water stress</strong>. Smart water sensors offer real-time monitoring and data-driven insights to optimize water usage, reduce waste, and detect issues such as leaks or overuse early.</p>
